This is consolidated list of Udacity Flying Car Nanodegree projects.

# FLYING CAR NANODEGREE - UDACITY
1) Project: Backyard Flyer    
Learn about our quadrotor test platform, work in our custom simulator, and build your first project—getting a quadrotor to take-off and fly around a backyard!      

2) Project: Planning     
Optimize 2D solutions using waypoints, then scale solutions to 3D problems. Apply these skills by autonomously navigating your drone through a dense urban environment.     

3) Project: Control    
Moving a flying vehicle requires determining appropriate low-level motor controls. Here, you’ll build a nonlinear cascaded controller for your drone system.    

4) Project: Estimation    
Utilize sensor fusion and filtering. Design an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate attitude and position from IMU and GPS data of a flying robot.
